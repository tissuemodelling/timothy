## About Timothy

Timothy is a novel large scale parallel computational model allowing 3-D simulations of cell colonies growing and interacting with variable environment in previously unavailable tissue scale.

The cells are modeled as individuals located in the lattice-free 3-D space. The model incorporates cellular environment modelled in a continuous manner, mathematical description based on partial differential equations is formulated for selected important components of the environment. Discrete and continuous formulations are efficiently coupled in one model and allow considerations on different scales: sub-cellular, cellular and tissue scale.

High parallel scalability achieved allows simulation of up to 10<sup>9</sup> individual cells. This large scale computational approach allows for simulations to be carried out over realistic spatial scales up to 1cm<sup>3</sup> in size i.e. the tissue scale.

### Main features
- **multiscale individual-based model**: subcellular,cellular and tissue scale
- **hybrid formulation**: discrete cells, continuous environment
- **highly scalable**: parallelized with MPI/OpenMP programming model, optimized for execution on massively parallel systems
